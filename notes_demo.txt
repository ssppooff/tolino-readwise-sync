Think Like a Programmer (Spraul, V. Anton)
Highlight on page 18: "However, our inability to plan a complete solution does not prevent us from making strategies or employing techniques to systematically solve the puzzle. In solving programming problems, we are sometimes faced with situations where we can’t see a clear path to code the solution, but we must never allow this to be an excuse to forgo planning and systematic approaches. It’s better to develop a strategy than to attack the problem through trial and error."

Flow (Csikszentmihalyi, Mihaly)
Highlight on page 11: "“Don’t aim at success—the more you aim at it and make it a target, the more you are going to miss it. For success, like happiness, cannot be pursued; it must ensue…as the unintended side-effect of one’s personal dedication to a course greater than oneself.”"

Note on page 20: So do keep frequently used files on your desktop? ^^
"Incidentally, Zipf also provided a scientific justification for the messy desk by justifying clutter with another law: frequency of use draws near to us things that are frequently used. Intelligent secretaries have long known that files in frequent use should not be filed!"
